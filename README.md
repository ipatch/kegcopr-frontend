> This Node.js app built around React and friends is designed to experiment with React and JavaScript related technologies.  It may amount to something it may not ...time will tell.

Presently this app is a React front-end that uses some Redux, but the redux logic is present when view the app on the web only for messing around with things locally for the moment.

## Old News

- Once upon time this project was bootstrapped with **create-react-app** that time is no longer.
- Originally this app was created to work with a Phoenix based API written in Elixir.

## TODO

- [ ] figure out the best course of action to move forward with the app.
- [ ] update, rewire a lot of the logic contained within the app _time permitting_ **of course**.
